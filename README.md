## Image Captioning with Deep Learning

This repository contains a robust implementation of an image captioning system that automatically generates captions for images. The project leverages the power of the VGG16 model, a pre-trained model on the ImageNet dataset, to extract features from images. Alongside, a sequence processing model is trained on the provided captions to learn the context and generate relevant text. 

The `VGG16` model is adapted to extract features from the image which then serve as the initial context to our LSTM model, a type of recurrent neural network. The captions are preprocessed to be tokenized and sequenced, fitting them for the LSTM model. To train the model, a data generator is built which ensures efficient memory usage while training. After the model is trained, it's evaluated using BLEU scores, providing a quantitative measure of its performance. Finally, some visualization utilities are provided to visually assess the predicted captions alongside the actual image.

The code is written in Python and extensively uses the TensorFlow framework. This system provides a foundational step in creating applications that need an understanding of the visual content, paving the way for advancements in areas like automated journalism, aiding visually impaired individuals, or enhancing social media platforms.
